HealthHub Frontend Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the HealthHub frontend on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Install Node.js on your system. Make sure it is up-to-date.
Steps to Run the Frontend
Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your terminal and go to the healthhub_ui folder:

bash

cd path/to/healthhub_ui
Install Dependencies

bash
npm install
If you are using the latest version of Node.js, use the following command instead:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
This will download and create the node_modules folder in the project directory.

Start the Frontend
After the dependencies are installed, start the frontend by running:

bash
npm start
Access the Application
Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:4200

Troubleshooting
If you face any issues, make sure your Node.js version is compatible with the project.
Check the error logs in the terminal for more details.
